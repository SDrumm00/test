# Python Load Script

This script will take multiple CSV's and XLSX files and concatenate them together.

# Limitations
At this time the data structure can only handle a limited number of columns. The folder structure is fairly strict and must be stated in advance and hard coded into the program.

# Enhancements
Ideally, the program should provide a prompt on where the files are located and it should also trigger what type of files are being loaded.

Error handling needs enhanced a lot.

Rather than simply concatenate the files together and gernerate a dumpfile into a sub-directory, why not also do the EDA?
  - Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis standards need coded. Can re-use old code for this.
